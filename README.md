## 🧩 Main Components & Tools

### 1. Data Ingestion & Orchestration

- **Apache Airflow** 🌀  
  Orchestrates workflows for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Automates model retraining and evaluation cycles.

- **PostgreSQL** 🐘  
  Reliable storage for structured retail data and forecasts.

- **MINIO** 🗄️  
  Object storage solution for handling large datasets and model artifacts, S3-compatible.

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline

- **MLflow** 🔗  
  Manages lifecycle of ML models: experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment.

- **Python** 🐍  
  Core language for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### 3. Serving & Visualization

- **Flask** 🍶  
  Lightweight API framework for serving model predictions.

- **Streamlit** 📊  
  User-friendly dashboards to visualize data and forecasts interactively.

- **Spring** 🌱  
  (Potential Java backend for more complex API needs.)
